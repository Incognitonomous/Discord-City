(image generated by the bot in my test server)

# Current features
- members represented by some form of shape on the map
- colours correspond to name colour in the server
- size corresponds to the number of messages sent
- server owner has a crown in the middle
- admins have a wall surrounding the server owner
- boosters have their own walls 
- two outputs, svg and png. in the svg format, the names appear when hovering over the shapes

# TO DO
- replace svg output with html format
  - better hover over shape system, displaying nickname and pfp
  - server name displayed at the top
